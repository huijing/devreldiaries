Being the idiot that I am, I managed to schedule myself into a situation where I'm only home 9 days in the month of May. And I've done similar things in the past, but somehow this time I haven't been acclimating to the timezone changes as smoothly as I used to.

Right now, I'm on the 2nd stop of a 5-talk stretch, but in a timezone 15 hours behind my usual timezone of GMT+8. I'd just done Cluj, which was GMT+3, went home for about 5 days, before coming out to San Francisco. And to be honest, I don't think I've slept more than 3 or 4 hours over the past 2 weeks.

This is the worst example of how a Developer Advocate should handle travel methinks, because operating on limited sleep is so bad for health. But nobody forced me to do this, and I kind of brought it on myself. I just didn't expect to find sleeping at night in a different timezone so difficult this time around.

It feels as if my body is insisting on keeping to my home timezone, which works out to me being the most sleepy between noon to 3pm, and struggling not to fall over. Best part is, my talk slot is smack in the middle of that time period, so I honestly don't know how things will go.

Fingers crossed that the adrenaline will keep my energy levels high enough to deliver a good presentation, and I can crash out after that. Did I also mention it's a brand new talk on an unfamiliar topic? The research process was great though, learned a tonne.

Plus, it's a 45 minute time slot, which is 15 minutes longer than my usual talk length. This will be exciting. Stay tuned for a recap.
