I just got back from [JSHeroes](https://jsheroes.io/) and it was an amazing experience. There were an estimated 700 developers in the audience, which is the biggest crowd I've ever spoken in front of to date. 

The energy from the crowd was really nice, especially when I managed to nail my opening line of “Mno servus oameni buni”, which was a very localised Romanian greeting specific to Cluj, albeit with a slight Hungarian accent. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Big thanks to my buddy, [Alex Lakatos](https://twitter.com/lakatos88), for coaching me through the pronunciation. The trip to Cluj was rather long, being a 2-stop flight and all, but somehow I couldn't acclimatise to the timezone change as well as I used to. When I met up with [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo) and she was trying to introduce me to [Simona Cotin](https://twitter.com/simona_cotin), I forgot my own name for about 3 seconds.

But overall, it was really nice to catch up with friends I'd made over the past 3 years via various conferences, as well as meet people I'd only known on Twitter. The line-up at JSHeroes was fantastic, with 23 speakers covering a diverse range of topics.

I generally am not a big fan of going near the end (I was the 19th talk overall and 3rd to last talk of the conference), but I got some positive feedback after my talk, which was nice.

What's even nicer is the gathering of Mozilla TechSpeakers, as there were 8 of us there, enough for each of us to carry 1 letter of the JSHeroes logo for a [photo op](https://twitter.com/mozTechSpeakers/status/1116767775320621056).

If you do get a chance to attend, go for it. The organisers did a solid job and tickets for the [2020 edition](https://ti.to/cluj-javascripters/jsheroes-2020) are already on sale.
