My friend, [Yu Po](https://mobile.twitter.com/lovevfp), is currently working at [Yuque (语雀)](https://www.yuque.com/), a platform for the creation and sharing of technical knowledge. Originally an internal tool used within [Ant Financial](https://www.antfin.com/) (蚂蚁金服), it is currently used by more than 50,000 Alibaba Group employees for documentation and knowledge-base maintenance.

Yuque is now open to public, and is like a combination of Medium and ReadTheDocs, where you can have articles collected into publications, as well as a documentation style layout where you navigate through sections from the left sidebar. Most of the content is written in Chinese, though there are some English posts on there as well.

Personally I'm only fluent in 2 languages, English and Chinese. But even so, as someone who has only worked in tech using the English language, writing blog posts in Chinese was a new challenge for me. I hadn't wrote prose-length Chinese content since I graduated high school, to be honest. I'm slowly building up a glossory of technical terms as I read more Chinese content and try to write more of it as well.

Which led me to think about the impact of computing originating from English-speaking locales on the rest of the world. If you think about how software is built, many decisions made during the beginning of the project usually have lasting consequences for years to come. And here we are talking about an entire industry that has taken over the planet.

Anyway, just a random musing. If you do read Chinese, maybe you'd like to take a look at [my interpretation of what DevRel is](https://www.yuque.com/huijing/devreldiaries/haeza6)?
